# 4XRD

An augmented reality playground for the 4th dimension!

## Development

You will need a number of prerequisites:

- An up-to-date version of Unity Editor LTS, e.g. Unity 6 (6000.0.37f1)
- Git and Git LFS

Make sure your Git LFS is set up and working. You can then clone the repository as usual:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaylendog/4XRD.git
```
